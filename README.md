Experimenting with data science using python notebooks 

In Project 1, I analyze cities in Europe based on Quallity of Life Index using various factors like Cost of Living, Environment Quality, HEalthcare, Housing, Business Freedom, Education, Commute etc. 

Data Collected from APIs is stored in a sub-directory Data 
Results obtained from the analysis are stored in a sub-directory Results

Project 2 is about text classification. Data is scraped from a website, yalp.com, prepared for modelling and classified based on the content. The labels for training are derived from the star-ratings given by the users. 

Data collected from the website is stored in a sub-directory Data 
Classifiers are built and trained to classify positive and negative reviews. Positive reviews are considered to be those for which the user gave a rating 4 or higher. Reviews with ratings less than 4 should be classified as negative reviews.
